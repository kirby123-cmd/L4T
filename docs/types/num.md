integer
num The type can handle 8-byte signed integers. The following operations can be performed between types.num

Binomial arithmetic
Assignment
The assignment operation is performed in .:

a: 10
a is assigned to .10

b: a
b is assigned the value of .a

a: b: 100
b After is assigned to , is also assigned to , because the assignment of L4T is not an assignment "statement" but an assignment "expression" and is evaluated as an assigned value.100a100

Logical Or
First, the left expression is evaluated, and only when the left expression is , and both are evaluated as , and the rest are evaluated as . It is useful to use in combination with if-elif-else statements and loop statements.0001

a: 5
b: 10
c: a < 4 || b > 10
c is assigned to .0

Logical And
It evaluates the left expression first, evaluates the right expression only when the left expression is not , evaluates to if neither is , and evaluates to , otherwise evaluates to . It is useful to use in combination with if-elif-else statements and loop statements.0010

a: 3
b: 10
c: a < 4 && b > 10
c is assigned to .0

Equality
First, the left expression is evaluated, followed by the right expression, which evaluates to when the two values are equal and when they are different. It is useful to use in combination with if-elif-else statements and .10

a: 3
b: a = 3
b is assigned to .1

a: 3
b: a != 3
b is assigned to .0

Relational
It first evaluates the left expression, followed by the right expression, which evaluates to or is based on the relationship between the magnitudes of the two values. It is useful to use in combination with if-elif-else statements and .10

a: 3
b: a < 3
b is assigned to .0

a: 3
b: a <= 3
b is assigned to .1

a: 3
b: a > 3
b is assigned to .0

a: 3
b: a >= 3
b is assigned to .1

Shift

Additive
The sum is ,the difference is done by .+-

a: 10
b: 20
c: a + b - 200
c is assigned to .-170

Multiplicative
The product is , the quotient is by , and the remainder is .\*/%

a: 10 / 5
a is assigned to .2

a: 10
b: 3
c: a % b
c is assigned to .1

a: 12
b: a \* 200
b is assigned to .2400
