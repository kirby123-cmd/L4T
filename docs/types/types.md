Every value in L4T has a type, such as a variable declared as or a value such as . In L4T, operations can only be performed on the same type, and variables declared as a type can only be assigned values of that type. This language specification enforces more secure coding, which makes it harder for us to create bugs in our implementations.num aa1234num
